<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm unique. I'm a senior executive who has the power to build his own software.</p>

<p>Story starts as a one of 6 refugee chidren, an invalid father who was paralysed from the kneck down
  with a strong mother. Somehow managed to move our of the councile estate, get an eduction and make a living. Gained an Msc
  in AI, Control Systems and an Insead MBA which all seems to have led to nought!
</p>

<p>Life  took a turn again. Out of work and over 50. I found that despite my eduction and eperience
  noone would hire me. Ageisim + racism, who knows. Life has never been linear. I decided to go back to
  what I started in life doing which is to write software. I have lots of regrets, anger, frustration.
  Always, looked after myself and never asked for help of favours. Or when I did, I never received. never
  been part of the good old boys club!
